# Czech Typographical Keyboard

Czech typographical keyboard layout definition for [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts).

Layout is based on Czech (QWERTZ) layout and preserve most of it – only removes never-used symbols with stroke (`đĐłŁ`). 

Czech Typographical Keyboard adds some characters useful for typography and programming 
— such as `‚‘` and `„“` (Czech single and double quotation marks), `—` (m-dash), `–` (n-dash)
`…` (ellipsis), `×÷−±` (mathematical signs multiplication, division, minus and plus-minus), 
`` ` `` (backtick – nondead grave accent), `^` (caret – nondead circumflex accent) 
or `αβγλπ` (some symbols of Greek alphabet).
